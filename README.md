# My-Google-Meet-Manager

### Setup Instructions : 

- It can find all the google meet links from google classrooms that you are joined to, 

    - If you have a single classroom to be entered, run the following command

        ```python
        python3 my_google_meet_manager.py -a 
        ```
        > This will Add a single classroom based on the details you provide and automatically scrapes the meet link if available

    - If you want to add google classroom details in bulk, use the following tag

        ```python
        python3 my_google_meet_manager.py -b 
        ```
        > This gives bulk addition functionality, and automatically scrapes the classroom link from given **class_details.txt** file to find the meet link

        **Requires a class_details.txt** to be present 
        
        class_details.txt structure ( each column seperation by ; ) -> 

        <class_code> ; <course_code> ; <classroom_link>

    **The above two command results in generation fo class_schedule.csv file**

- For changing the details of a classroom, run the following command 

    ```python
    python3 my_google_meet_manager.py -c 
    ```
    > This changes details of a classroom from given menu of class_schedule.csv
 
- For timetable creation, run the following command 

    ```python
    python3 my_google_meet_manager.py -t 
    ```
    > This first asks for (one or two letter) codes of your classes, just like in a Timetable to represent a course

    > Then asks for your Timetable for each day from Mon-Fri from 8:30-5:30 

    > Finally generates a timetable.csv which has the timetable schedule used for running the main part of the script



### Running the script : 

    ```python
    python3 my_google_meet_manager.py
    ```

   > Running with no tags 

   > Fetches current day and time and joins respective google meet link via browser, also turns your microphone and camera off 

### For scheduling : 

- **If using crontab (Linux)** :

  > run the following command : 
  ```
  crontab -e
  ```
  > enter the following commmands accordingly : 

    ```
    # Sets display environment variable for crontab so that selenium works as without it chrome wont open
    # to find display number, run 
    # env | grep 'DISPLAY'
    DISPLAY=:1
    # For setting environment for crontab so that pulseaudio works
    # here 1000 is the usr_id
    # to get usr_id, run : echo $UID
    XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="/run/user/1000"

    # It also creates a "meet_manager.log" in home directory
    32 8-16 * * 1-5 cd /home/<user>/<path_to_repo>/meet_automation && /usr/bin/python3 /home/<user>/<path_to_repo>/meet_automation/my_google_meet_manager.py >> /home/<user>/meet_manager.log 2>&1 
    ```
